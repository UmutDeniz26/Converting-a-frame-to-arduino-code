Steps to use the program

1 - ) Create a scence(to create a scence ,type 1 into the cell that you want to paint), according to your LED strip, by excel. 

2 - ) Select the scence and click to "get data from a table" .

3 - ) Press Ctrl+A and copy all cells(1 and null).

4 - ) Paste these to https://www.gillmeister-software.com/online-tools/text/remove-line-breaks.aspx ("Keep empty lines" should be unchecked).

5 - ) Then,copy the result and paste into excelToCodeStep1.

6 - ) Copy the result and paste into excelToCodeStep2.

7 - ) Copy the output and paste (like i do in "demoLedEffect.ino") to arduino code.

Also you can convert multiple scenes at once, with same steps.

(I showed these steps in with pictures in the steps folder)

It's amateurish, but it works.  :)
