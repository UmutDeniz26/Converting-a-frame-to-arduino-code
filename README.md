Steps to use the program

1 - ) Create a frame(to create a frame ,type 1 into the cell that you want to paint), according to your LED strip, by excel. 

2 - ) Select the frame and click to "get data from a table" .

3 - ) Press Ctrl+A and copy all cells(which contain 1 or null).

4 - ) Paste these to https://www.gillmeister-software.com/online-tools/text/remove-line-breaks.aspx ("Keep empty lines" should be unchecked).

5 - ) Then,copy the result and paste into excelToCodeStep1.

6 - ) Copy the result and paste into excelToCodeStep2.

7 - ) Finally,copy the output and paste (like i do in "demoLedEffect.ino") to arduino code.

!!!! Also you can convert multiple frame at once, with same steps. !!!!

(I showed these steps in with pictures in the steps folder)

It's amateurish, but it works.  :)
